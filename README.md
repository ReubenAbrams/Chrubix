WELCOME

Chrubix provides secure GNU/Linux for ARM-based Chromebooks. Tails would be
the best alternative if you own an Intel-based Chromebook or laptop. This
project's code base is licensed under the GPL and is available for free.

QUICK START

If you don't own an ARM-based Chromebook, buy one. If you already own one, follow these simple instructions.

1 Enter Developer Mode.
* Make sure your laptop is OFF.
* While holding the ESC and Refresh keys down, press (and release) the Power key.
* Count to 10.
* Press Control-D.
* Press Enter.
* Walk away. Come back in 10 minutes.

2 Log into ChromeOS.
* At the power-on screen, press Control-D.
* Log in to your Chromebook as usual. I assume you've configured your GMail account and WiFi network.
* Open your web browser.
* Press Control-Alt-T.
* Type shell <Enter>.

3 Install Chrubix.
* Insert an SD card into the port on the left-hand side of the computer.
* At the hash ('#') prompt, type the following: _cd; wget bit.do/that; bash that_ <Enter/>

4 Answer the on-screen questions.
* Choose your GNU/Linux distribution.
* Are you a deeply paranoid person? Answer 'y' or 'n'.
* Wait. The computer will reboot after 15-30 minutes.
* Press Control-U.
* Enjoy!
